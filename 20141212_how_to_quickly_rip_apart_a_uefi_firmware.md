Imagine this. It's been a couple of months since you upgraded your trusty laptop with a good old SSD, the speed is fair but there's just something wrong. Hibernation is taking ages, but why? You rip your firmware apart and find out they've crippled your S-ATA controller..

Enter the [Panasonic Toughbook CF-19 MK3](http://www.panasonic.com/business/toughbook/fully-rugged-laptop-toughbook-19.asp), one of those built-as-a-tank laptops used by government agencies all around, and its [Intel ICH9M chipset](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/io/io-controller-hub-9-datasheet.html), crippled but cool.
